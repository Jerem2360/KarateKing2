A game I am coding just for fun.
Python version 3.9.

Required modules are in requirements.txt
They can also be installed by running requirements.bat, passing it the pip instance as an argument.
e.g. :

`requirements.bat pip`  would run `pip install ...`

`requirements.bat python -m pip` would run `python -m pip install ...`
